Then, in your Addressable Settings, add the new Variant Assets Build script to your list of "Build and Play Mode Scripts"

## Schema and Groups

The build script will only run on Addressable Groups with the ProcessVariantAssetsSchema.

With that schema added, then any number of VariantAssetsScript assets can be added.  Example, create the instances in a folder in "AddressableAssetsData/VariantAssetScripts".

## ProcessVariantAssetsScript

The abstract class ProcessVariantAssetsScript can be derived from to make new variant processing scripts. These are scriptable objects and instances of them are add to the ProcessVariantAssetsSchema to be processed.
